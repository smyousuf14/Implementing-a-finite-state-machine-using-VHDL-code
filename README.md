# Implementing-a-finite-state-machine-using-VHDL-code
The purpose of this project is o simulate and verify the operation of a sequential circuit
and to design a finite state machine (FSM) that cycles through the individual digits of my student ID using the assigned state diagrams.  

The design of the finite state machine(FSM) was implemented through VHDL and complied through Quartus II. It was further tested and verified using Altera FPGA.
